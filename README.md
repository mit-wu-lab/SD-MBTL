## Installation
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Training RL policies and evaluating on CMDP

We consider two types of tasks: synthetic and real-world tasks. The synthetic tasks are generated using the `gen_synthetic_data.ipynb`, while the real-world tasks are generated using four environments under `envs/`.

### Synthetic tasks
The synthetic tasks are generated using the `gen_synthetic_data.ipynb` notebook. The notebook generates the data and saves it in the `data/` directory. You can run the notebook to generate the data.

### Real-world tasks
The real-world tasks are generated using the following environments:
- [CartPole and BipedalWalker](./envs/control-tasks/)
- [CyclesGym](./envs/cyclesgym/)
- [IntersectionZoo](./envs/intersectionzoo/)

### Download the data

You can download the synthetic and real-world datasets from the following links:

- [Data (Synthetic and Real-World)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xna4P9ddZETb46ai0T6vg08eVwZ-oloQ/view?usp=sharing)

After downloading the data, unzip it and place the contents in the `data/` directory.

## Run SD-MBTL and baselines

### Run SD-MBTL and baselines in synthetic tasks (CartPole, BipedalWalker, IntersectionZoo, and CyclesGym)

3 dimensional tasks:
```bash
bash s-run-main-synt.sh
```

5 dimensional tasks:
```bash
bash s-run-main-synt5d.sh
```

7 dimensional tasks:
```bash
bash s-run-main-synt7d.sh
```

### Run SD-MBTL and baselines in real-world tasks (CartPole, BipedalWalker, IntersectionZoo, and CyclesGym)

```bash
bash s-run-main.sh
```

## Results

You can find the results in the `tables` and `figures` directories. The results are generated by running the `plot_figure.ipynb` notebook.

### Real-world tasks
The aggregated performance scales each MBTL-based algorithm’s performance between 0 and 1—reflecting how much it outperforms the Random baseline and how closely it approaches the Myopic Oracle—averaged across four benchmarks.
